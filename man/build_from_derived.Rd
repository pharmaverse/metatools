\title{Build a dataset from derived}
\usage{
build_from_derived(
  metacore,
  ds_list,
  dataset_name = NULL,
  predecessor_only = TRUE,
  keep = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{metacore}{metacore object that contains the specifications for the
dataset of interest.}

\item{ds_list}{Named list of datasets that are needed to build the from. If
the list is unnamed,then it will use the names of the objects.}

\item{dataset_name}{Optional string to specify the dataset that is being
built. This is only needed if the metacore object provided hasn't already
been subsetted.}

\item{predecessor_only}{By default \code{TRUE}, so only variables with the origin
of 'Predecessor' will be used. If \code{FALSE} any derivation matching the
dataset.variable will be used.}

\item{keep}{Boolean to determine if the original columns should be kept. By
default \code{FALSE}, so only the ADaM columns are kept. If \code{TRUE} the resulting
dataset will have all the ADaM columns as well as any SDTM column that were
renamed in the ADaM (i.e \code{ARM} and \code{TRT01P} will be in the resulting
dataset)}
}
\value{
dataset
}
\description{
This function builds a dataset out of the columns that just need to be pulled
through. So any variable that has a derivation in the format of
'dataset.variable' will be pulled through to create the new dataset. When
there are multiple datasets present, they will be joined by the shared
\code{key_seq} variables. These columns are often called 'Predecessors' in ADaM,
but this is not universal so that is optional to specify.
