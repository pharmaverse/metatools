\usage{
print_to_console(messages, data_list, strict_validation = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{messages}{A character vector of messages to be printed. Each element corresponds
to a separate message.}

\item{data_list}{A list of character vectors. Each element in the list corresponds
to a message in \code{messages} and provides associated data (e.g., column names).
If an element in \code{messages} has no corresponding data, include a \code{NULL}.}

\item{strict_validation}{A logical value indicating whether to print messages as
errors (\code{TRUE}, default) or warnings (\code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
None. The function's primary purpose is its side effect of printing a message.
It does not return a meaningful value.
}
\description{
This function prints formatted messages to the console, either as errors (stopping
execution) or as warnings. It is designed as a helper function to provide informative
messages during validation checks.
}
\details{
The function constructs a formatted message string including the calling
function's name, the individual messages provided in \code{messages}, and associated data
from \code{data_list}. The function uses \code{switch} to call either \code{stop()} or \code{warning()}
based on \code{strict_validation} and prints the full message string to the console.
